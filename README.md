## Node JS
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. You need to recollect that NodeJS isn’t a framework, and it’s not a programing language. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.
## Express JS
Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node.js’s web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features.It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middle ware and routing; it adds helpful utilities to Node.js’s HTTP objects;it facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.
